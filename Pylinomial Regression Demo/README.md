# Pylinomial Regression Demo

This is a demo that describe how polynomial regressor works.

## Structure
- [PeDistance Polynomial Regression](PeDistance%20Polynomial%20Regression) is a jupyter notebook. This is the actual regressor demo. Watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/zw7G7hnkN3g) that describes how to use it.
- reg_state, requirements, yolov5s files are all used by PeDistance Polynomial Regression notebook.
- [ModDatasetToYolo](ModDatasetToYolo) is a jupyter notebook. It is used to parse PeDistance Dataset to a yolo version where it is used as features extractor.

## Resources
Download the Demo Dataset [here](https://mega.nz/file/izIAzLjA#qehjpfVecjNGHt7-_YdjD6LSTcgXto2ZMrlHqXVeMwU). Keep in mind that this is just a sample of 10K records. You can use [PeDistance Mod](../PeDistance%20Mod) to generate your own dataset to train your Network/regressor/classifier.
