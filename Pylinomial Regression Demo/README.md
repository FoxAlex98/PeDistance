# Pylinomial Regression Demo

This is a demo that describe how polynomial regressor works.

## Structure
- [PeDistance Polynomial Regression](PeDistance%20Polynomial%20Regression) is a jupyter notebook. This is the actual regressor demo. Watch the video here (insert link) that describes how to use it.
- reg_state, requirements, yolov5s files are all used by PeDistance Polynomial Regression notebook.
- [ModDatasetToYolo](ModDatasetToYolo) is a jupyter notebook. It is used to parse PeDistance Dataset to a yolo version where it is used ad features exstractor.
