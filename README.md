# PeDistance

PeDistance is an automatic dataset generator which can be used to train Machine Learning or Computer Vision algoritms. It uses GTA V mod to generate dataset based on the distance between a pedestrian and a set camera point. A polynomial regressor is trained as demo to make prevision about people distance in an image. More info below.

## Structure
- [PeDistance Mod](PeDistance%20Mod) is where you can find mod related files. Check the README inside for more.
- [Pylinomial Regression Demo](Pylinomial%20Regression%20Demo) is where you can find polynomial regression related notebooks and files. Check the README inside for more.
